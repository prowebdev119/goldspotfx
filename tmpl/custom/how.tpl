            peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks which makes it so remarkable. All
            transactions between the bitcoin users are verified by network nodes and recorded in open shared ledger
            referred to as the blockchain. A record of each transaction is shown in the log of the user as well. Through
            many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous
            payment system.
